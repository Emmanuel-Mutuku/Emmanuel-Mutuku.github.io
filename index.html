    <h2 class="author">About</h2>
      <p>I am Emmanuel Mutuku Afolabi, an 18 year old Kenyan who has enormous dreams. My goal usually is being myself every five years to come. I am an Alumni of Alliance High School and currently joining African Leadership Academy class of 2018.I also ventured into music and I'm currently the guitarist of Insomnia the band.Feel free to check out our Instagram handle here and follow us! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/insomnia_the_band/"<em>@insomnia_the_band</em></a>
        .My passion for technology just begun a few months ago when I got fascinated by a book called <strong>"Zero to One"</strong>.I also look forward to joining Stanford University and winning the best husband and father annual award.</p>
    <h3 class="author">Achievements</h3>
      <p><strong>At the tender age of 15, I realised that I had a passion for Entrepreneurship and Technology related activities. It wasn't just a passion, it was more since I really wanted to venture into it at that early age.I started a small organistaion known as <em>Jani Journey Organisation</em>.It's simply a mentorship organisation that embraces the dreams of the youth and helpsthem nurture the dreams into reality.In 2015, I managed to qualify for the Students for the Advancement of Global Entrepreneurship(SAGE) that was held in South Korea where I managed to win 2 Gold medals for The Millenium Developments Goals and emerged as the second runner up representing Kenya! In 2016, I went further to qualify for the SAGE WoldCup that was held in Manilla, Philippines where we managed to win 5 out of the possible 17 Sustainable Development Goals making Kenya the first country in Africa to do so. There after I attended the Barrack Obama Leadership Program in the USA which came as a result of our achievements as the Jani Journey Crew! That's just but a few bearing in mind that my age is a restriction and result to such a short achievement list.</strong> </p>

      <h5 class="author"><strong>The Genesis of Jani-Journey</strong></h5>
      <h6 class="author">The Story Behind it.</h6>
        <p>Ever since some of the Jani  Journey members got opportunities to tour the world they came back with one similar thing; EXPOSURE! Some even thought that the young generation back at home has no future at all since everyone is being taught how to compete with one another so as to secure opportunities instead of collaborating with one another so as to create opportunities.</p>
        <p>The Alumni of The Alliance High School, The Alliance Girls High School, The Kenya High School & The Kapsabet Boys High School thought of a way of improvising on the orthodox methods of mentorship that most of the time are not effective to the young generation.( What we call the normal boring talks) Through activities, the young can actually benefit more in almost all aspects and develop in better ways so as to be able to stand on their own with Independent and Realistic mindsets. We simply came up with a program that is based on what we call the 5Câ€™s( Choice, Communication, Critical Thinking, Collaboration, & Creativity) These are simply the Values we use to make a better generation.</p>
        <p>The Program simply takes up individuals with so much HIDDEN potential and makes the potential visible by bettering others. The question is how do we do this? We enroll people aged between 13 and 17 into our program whereby they are taken through short courses for self realization after which evaluation is done and one is taken to the other level which involves Self Expression and application into some of these abroad Exchange Programs that we are talking about : Yale Young Global Scholars, Yale Young African Scholars, Students For The Advancement Of Global Entrepreneurship, Barrack Obama Leadership Program, Stanford High School Summer Session & The Experiment Of International Living.</p>
        <p>Here are some of the Young people responsible for the great work done by Jani Journey Organisation:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emmanuel Mutuku
          <li>Kevin Macharia
          <li>Melanie Nkirote
          <li>Briggite Ogega
          <li>Shadrack Nzuki

          <li>Bill Mutuma
          <li>Whitney Ouma

        <p>This and so much more awaits the young generation so that they can make a difference to Society. We can never solve the problems we created with the same minds that created them.Lets die with memories and not Dreams, <em>This is Jani Journey</em>!</p>
